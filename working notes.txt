Working Notes

  Should make the .onLoad etc. classes just data-onLoad="" and then parse from there.
  Can grab them with jQuery $('[data-onload]')
  http://api.jquery.com/has-attribute-selector/
  
  Need to combine loadview and loadsubview like this:
      
      <a href="" data-loadview="dashboard, #walrus">

  The url variables can be standardized to ~a=b&b=c&c=d
  Just make an array out of all the variables so you can call them by name
  Pass that array to js
  
  You could have it to where when people land on a page it prompts them to log in
  and it holds the url variables and passes those in with the login?
  
  Router could be where we check sessions? Not index.php
  
  Still need to add ajax file uploading with progress bar
  
  Mino uses file structure and filesystem functions to decipher
  a website's structure, rather than storing that information in a database.
  
    To Do:
    
      - Make headers and footers in their own file structure in the client folder
      - Connect headers and footers to pages in router
