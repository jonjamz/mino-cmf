It's Mino
=========

It's...
- a project I created a few years ago, so it's got some older versions of things, but it's still cool!
- a modular PHP/MySQL framework, influenced by early Node frameworks, but with a kickass HTML5 templating model
- pretty decent for rapid prototyping of startup ideas (although I'd recommend Meteor over this nowadays)
- almost got its own DSL, in an abandoned private repo
- mostly a learning project...I wasn't particularly good at JS when I wrote it, just jQuery

The good news is that _despite not having any tests, it works?_
