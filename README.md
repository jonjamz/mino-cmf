It's Mino
=========

It's...
- a project I created a few years ago, so it's got some older versions of things, but it's still cool!
- a modular PHP/MySQL framework, influenced by early Node frameworks, for rapid prototyping of startup ideas
- almost got its own DSL, in an abandoned private repo
- got a few flaws, I mean, it was mostly a learning project...I wasn't particularly good at JS when I wrote it, just jQuery

The good news is that _despite not having any tests, it works?_
